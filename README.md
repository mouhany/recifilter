# Features

## Login / Register Page

![Login page](./static/other/login.png)
![Register page](./static/other/register.png)
Users have to create an account prior to using this application. Validation is implemented in both front end and back end. Users have to provide a name (which will be used to greet users in the index page), a minimum of four-alphanumeric-characters username that will be used to identify which user has logged in, and a password. The password stored in the database is hashed first, but for safety measures, **PLEASE DO NOT USE YOUR ACTUAL PASSWORD!**

## Index Page

![Index page](./static/other/index.png)
![Index with input](./static//other/index_input.png)
Users can find recipes by ingredients / keywords in the text field, by checklists, or a combination of both. Input will be sent to back end via get request since we're only using it to retrieve a JSON data from the API.

- ### Text Field

The index page consists of a text field that can be added or removed dynamically with javascript [(tutorial can be found here)](https://youtu.be/Zu_fu6vxevw). Empty value in the text field is handled in the back end e.g. if users added four text field but only typed in two, the back end will recognize it as two keywords and the headline in the result page will only show these two keywords.
User can also use the text field as it is, but a comma separated keywords is expected for this method.

- ### Checklists
